Atomic and molecular systems exposed to strong external fields are
extensively explored.

The water molecule, in particular, has received considerable attention
in ion-molecule collision studies~[\textcolor{red}{REFS}] due to its
relevance in applied fields, such as radiation therapy. The
multicentre nature of its potential makes the water molecule an
attractive and challenging problem, and a diversity of approximations
have been implemented in order to learn about its molecular structure
as well as about the impact of external perturbations such as
ion-molecule-collisions~[\textcolor{red}{REFS}], strong dc
fields~[\textcolor{red}{REFS}] and high-intensity laser
fields~[\textcolor{red}{REFS}].

High-intensity laser-atom interactions are the origin of phenomena
such as above threshold ionization~(\textsc{ati}), in which reveals an
atom may absorb many more photons than the minimum necessary for
ionization~[\textcolor{red}{REFS}].
% rephrase this sentence (ATI chaper by Becker)
Under the effect of an intense laser field, an atom that is initially
in its ground state gets ionized at some given time followed by the
ejection of an electron that interacts with the laser field once it is
promoted to the continuum and eventually rescatters to within the
vicinity of the binding potential as the external field changes
direction. As a consequence of this interaction, an \textsc{ati}
spectrum consisting of a sequence of peaks separated by the photon
energy is generated. The study of this spectrum has been of increased
interest as it reveals features that describe the mechanism of
interaction of an atom with an external field~[\textcolor{red}{REFS}].

Events of strong dc field ionization of the water molecule valence
orbitals and laser-induced ionization of atoms constitute the essence
of this work. This study involves deriving an effective potential that
reproduces the symmetry properties of each molecular orbital as an
initial step in the calculation of the Stark resonance parameters for
the water molecule under an external static electric field.
% rephrase this mentioning that solving a tdse is computationally
% taxing and an intricate problem
The interaction of a strong laser field with atoms, in particular, the
phenomenon of \textsc{ati} is addressed within a framework that allows
to uncover the underlying physics without having to resort to
computationally demanding tools such as solving the time-dependent
Schr\"{o}dinger equation. A generalization of the strong-field
approximation~(\textsc{sfa})~[\textcolor{red}{REFS}] is implemented
within two independent frameworks: a semi-classical approach involving
quantum paths~[\textcolor{red}{REFS}] and a numerical evaluation of
the exact \textsc{sfa} results~[\textcolor{red}{REFS}].

Since the work of Ellison and Shull~\cite{EllisonShullh2o_1955},
numerous theoretical studies that attempt to formulate an accurate
description of the H$_{2}$O molecule have been reported. The
self-consistent field~(\textsc{scf}) method introduced by
Roothaan~\cite{Roothaan_1951}, which allows to represent the
Hartree-Fock orbitals of a molecule as expansions of basis functions,
has been widely implemented in the study of the ground state and
symmetry properties of H$_{2}$O. Within the \textsc{scf} framework,
the molecular orbitals wave functions have been approximated using
multicentre Slater-type atomic orbitals as basis
sets~\cite{Reeves_nature_1956,natureH2O_1960,Pitzer_1968,Pitzer_1970},
as well as Gaussian basis
functions~\cite{gaussianH2O_1965,Neumann_gaussian_1968}. On a similar
note, one-centre expansions were resorted to as attempts to bypass the
difficulty of evaluating multicentre
integrals~\cite{Moccia_1964,oneCentre_1961,Parr_JCP_1960}, however,
inherent to this method is the additional difficulty of needing a more
extensive set of basis functions. As an example, Moccia introduced an
expansion of the H$_{2}$O \textsc{mo}s in terms of Slater-type
functions all centred at the nucleus of the oxygen
atom~\cite{Moccia_1964}. This work, in which the author determined the
expansion coefficients of a linear combination consisting of $28$
Slater-like functions by means of Roothaan's \textsc{scf} method,
obtained wave functions that led to remarkably accurate values for the
total energy and the ground state configuration of H$_{2}$O.

Solving the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation~(\textsc{tdse}) in
the study of static-field ionization rates could perhaps seem like a
logical effort that leads to highly accurate solutions. This approach
has been implemented, within the framework of Hermitian quantum
mechanics, in tunneling calculations for the helium
atom~\cite{static_tdse_He,static_tdse_He_method} in which the
two-electron Schr\"{o}dinger equation was solved and the results were
in good agreement with previous
calculations~\cite{static_He_scrinzi}. However, obtaining a numerical
solution to the many-body \textsc{tdse} remains a challenging problem
even for a small number of particles.

 


Molecular static-field ionization has been addressed by means of
complex variable techniques which are associated to a non-Hermitian
formulation of quantum mechanics. The H$_{2}$O molecule, which is of
interest in this work, has served as reference of nonlinear molecule
under strong external fields. Tunneling data on static-field
ionization of H$_{2}$O can be found in calculations on its tunneling
ionization regime within the weak-field asymptotic
theory~\cite{Toru_weakF_H2O,Toru_weakF_molec}. In this work the
authors presented an accurate description of the asymptotic behaviour
of the H$_{2}$O wave functions within the single-active-electron
approximation.




An alternative comes from the use of complex basis functions to solve
the many body Schr\"{o}dinger
equation~\cite{Jagau_manybody_H2O}~[\textcolor{red}{ELABORATE}].

Exterior complex scaling~[\textcolor{red}{REFS}] and complex absorbing
potentials~[\textcolor{red}{REFS}] are among the accepted approaches
to compute the discrete resonance states, and have also been useful at
investigations of Stark resonances induced by time dependent
field~\cite{ecsScrinzi,Krause_2014}.
