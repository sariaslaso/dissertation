\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}


Atomic and molecular systems exposed to strong external fields are
extensively explored. The water molecule, in particular, has received
considerable attention in ion-molecule collision
studies~[\textcolor{red}{REFS}] due to its relevance in applied
fields, such as radiation therapy. The multicentre nature of its
potential makes the water molecule an attractive and challenging
problem.




Atomic units $(\hbar = m = -e = 4\pi\epsilon_{0} = 1)$ are used
throughout.
