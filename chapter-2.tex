This chapter presents a brief compilation of the principles of the
Hartree-Fock (\textsc{hf}) formulation implemented in problems of
molecular quantum mechanics. Section~\ref{ch:var_hf} summarizes the
principles in the Roothaan formulation of the Hartree-Fock formalism,
in which the Hartree-Fock orbitals are expressed as linear
combinations of suitable analytical functions~\cite{Roothaan_HF}. For
molecules, the calculation of electronic wavefunctions is more
intricate than that for atoms since it is preferable to use basis
functions centred about the several
nuclei~\cite{Pitzer_1968,Pitzer_1970}. This implies the difficult task
of evaluating multicentre integrals~[REFS]. Sec.~\ref{ch:scf_sto}
describes a different approach that consists of using a set of basis
functions all referred to one common origin and has reported
satisfactory results in calculations of self-consistent field
molecular orbitals of AH$_{n}$-type molecules~\cite{Moccia_JCP_2164,
  Moccia_1964}.

As a starting point in the self-consistent field~(\textsc{scf})
molecular orbital~(\textsc{mo}) calculations, the molecular
Hartree-Fock wave function is written as the antisymmetrized product
(\textsc{ap}) of $N$ one-electron wave functions~\cite{Roothaan_HF},
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \begin{split}
    \Phi & = & \sqrt{N!}\psi_{1}^{[1} \psi_{2}^{\phantom{[]}2} \cdots \psi_{N}^{N]} =
    (N!)^{-1/2}
    \begin{vmatrix}
      \psi_{1}^{1} & \psi_{2}^{1} & \cdots & \psi_{N}^{1} \\
      \psi_{1}^{2} & \psi_{2}^{2} & \cdots & \psi_{N}^{2} \\
      \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots \\
      \psi_{1}^{N} & \psi_{2}^{N} & \cdots & \psi_{N}^{N}
    \end{vmatrix}
  \end{split},
  \label{eq:AP}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where each spin-orbital $\psi_{k}^{\mu} = \varphi_{i(k)}(x^{\mu},
y^{\mu}, z^{\mu}) \eta_{k}(s^{\mu})$ factors into a molecular orbital
and a spin function; the superscript $\mu$ indicates the spatial and
spin coordinates of the $\mu$th electron, and the subscripts $k$ and
$i$ label the different molecular spin-orbitals (\textsc{mso}'s) and
\textsc{mo}'s, respectively. The superscripts $[1\ 2 \cdots N]$
indicate that one must consider all the permutations of the sequence
$1\ 2 \cdots N$ such that the Pauli exclusion principle is satisfied,
that is, each \textsc{mo} $\varphi_{i}^{\mu}$ may occur not more than
twice (corresponding to opposite spin signs) in the product wave
function.

For a closed-shell structure, in which the \textsc{ap}~(\ref{eq:AP})
is made up of complete electron shells, the Hartree-Fock method looks
for those \textsc{mo}'s that minimize the variational
energy~\cite{Roothaan_HF}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \begin{split}
    E & = & 2\sum\limits_{i} H_{i} + \sum\limits_{i}\sum\limits_{j} (2J_{ij} -
    K_{ij}).
  \end{split}
  \label{eq:HF_energy}
\end{eqnarray}
%
The first sum in Eq.~(\ref{eq:HF_energy}) represents the energy of all
the electrons in the field of the nuclei alone, where the Hamiltonian
operator for the $i$th electron is $H_{i} = -\frac{1}{2}
\nabla_{i}^{2} - \sum\limits_{\alpha} \frac{1}{r^{i\alpha}}$. The
remaining sum contains the electronic interactions, in which the
Coulomb integrals $J_{ij}$ and exchange integrals $K_{ij}$ are defined
by
%
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:Coulomb}
    J_{ij} = \int \frac{\bar\varphi_{i}^{\mu} \bar\varphi_{j}^{\nu}
      \varphi_{i}^{\mu} \varphi_{j}^{\nu}}{r^{\mu\nu}} dv^{\mu\nu}
  \end{equation}
  %
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:exchange}
    K_{ij} = \int \frac{\bar\varphi_{i}^{\mu} \bar\varphi_{j}^{\nu}
      \varphi_{j}^{\mu} \varphi_{i}^{\nu}}{r^{\mu\nu}} dv^{\mu\nu}
  \end{equation}
\end{subequations}
%
where the integration goes over the spatial coordinates of the
$\mu$th and the $\nu$th electron

The Hartree-Fock \textsc{scf} method looks for those molecular
orbitals $\varphi_{i}$ that minimize the variational
energy~(\ref{eq:HF_energy}). In an iterative process, the molecular
orbitals that form the \textsc{ap}~(\ref{eq:AP}) are corrected by an
infinitesimal amount $\delta\varphi_{i}$, that along with the
requirement that the molecular orbitals continue to form an
orthonormal basis, leads to express the variation of the energy
as~\cite{Roothaan_HF}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \begin{split}
    \delta E & = & 2 \sum\limits_{i} \int (\delta\bar\varphi_{i})
    \{ H + \sum\limits_{j} (2J_{j} - K_{j}) \} \varphi_{i} dv +
    2 \sum\limits_{i} \int (\delta\varphi_{i})
    \{ \bar H + \sum\limits_{j} (2\bar J_{j} - \bar K_{j}) \}
    \bar\varphi_{i} dv
  \end{split}
  \label{eq:delta_Ehf}
\end{eqnarray}
%

% DESCRIBE THE STEPS THAT FORM THE HF SCF METHOD

Initially, one guesses an antisymmetric linear
combination~(\ref{eq:AP}) followed by a \textsc{scf} iterative process
until no further improvement is obtained in the wave functions.
