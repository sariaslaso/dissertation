relevant phenomena can occur, such as ATI




% what this dissertation investigates
This dissertation addresses the problem of dc field ionization of the
water molecule within the framework of non-Hermitian quantum
mechanics~(\textsc{nhqm}) in which the dc Stark resonance parameters
are obtained by means of solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in the
complex domain.
