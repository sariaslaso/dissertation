Atoms and molecules exposed to strong fields that are comparable to
their internal binding forces undergo ionization. This process allows
one to describe the basis of numerous strong-field ionization
phenomena such as above threshold ionization~(\textsc{ati}).  This
dissertation addresses a quantitative model of \textsc{ati}

This dissertation addresses the problem of dc field ionization of the
H$_{2}$O valence orbitals, $1b_{1}$, $1b_{2}$, and $3a_{1}$. The
calculations are performed within the framework of non-Hermitian
quantum mechanics, which allows to compute the dc Stark shifts and
exponential decay rates by means of solving the Schr\"{o}dinger
equation in the complex domain. Two independent models are implemented
in the study of static ionization of the molecular orbitals. One in
which a spherical effective potential obtained from a self-consistent
calculation of H$_{2}$O orbital energies using Slater-type orbitals as
basis functions is combined with an exterior complex scaling approach
to express the problem as a system of partial differential equations
that is solved numerically using a finite-element method. In the
second approach, a model potential for the H$_{2}$O molecule is
expanded in a basis of spherical harmonics and combined with a complex
absorbing potential that results in a complex eigenvalue problem for
the Stark resonances.

The rest of this investigation is concerned with the study of
\textsc{ati} for atoms subjected to a strong laser field. The
convergence of the ionization spectrum for a model-He atom is
addressed in a systematic study that is carried out following
Keldysh's formalism of strong field approximation~(\textsc{sfa}). A
generalized compact expression for the ionization amplitude that
incorporates electron rescattering into the analysis is explored as
well. Additionally, a model based on the concept of quantum paths is
implemented in the numerical evaluation of the \textsc{sfa} transition
amplitude. In this analysis, a coherent sum over all allowed quantum
trajectories that render the action stationary is carried out. This
calculation allows to generate an \textsc{ati} spectrum that converges
to the numerical Keldysh amplitude as the number of trajectories
increases.
