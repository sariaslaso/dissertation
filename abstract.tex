This dissertation addresses the problem of dc field ionization of the
H$_{2}$O valence orbitals, $1b_{1}$, $1b_{2}$, and $3a_{1}$. The
calculations are performed within the framework of non-Hermitian
quantum mechanics, which allows to compute the dc Stark shifts and
exponential decay rates by means of solving the Schr\"{o}dinger
equation in the complex domain. Two independent models are implemented
in the study of static ionization of the molecular orbitals. One in
which a spherical effective potential obtained from a self-consistent
calculation of H$_{2}$O orbital energies using Slater-type orbitals as
basis functions is combined with an exterior complex scaling approach
to express the problem as a system of partial differential equations
that is solved numerically using a finite-element method. In the
second approach, a model potential for the H$_{2}$O molecule is
expanded in a basis of spherical harmonics and combined with a complex
absorbing potential that leads to a complex eigenvalue problem for the
Stark resonances.

The rest of this investigation is concerned with the study of
\textsc{ati} for atoms subjected to a strong laser field. The
convergence of the ionization spectrum for a model-He atom is
addressed in a systematic study that is carried out within the
framework of the strong field approximation~(\textsc{sfa}).
