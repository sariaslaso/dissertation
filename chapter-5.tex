\label{cha:sp_approx}

%A semi-classical analysis of ATI which describes the formation of the
%ionization spectrum based on the interference of quantum paths is
%included in Sec.~\ref{sec:spa}. The direct ionization regime is
%considered independently in Sec.~\ref{sec:spa_direct}. The analysis
%presented in this chapter closely follows that
%of~\cite{KopoldOptComm2000}.

%\section{\label{sec:spa} Saddle point approximation}

For laser fields of sufficiently high intensity, the \textsc{ati}
spectrum can be generated by implementing a saddle point
evaluation~\cite{LewensteinSPA_1994} of the multidimensional integral
for the transition amplitude obtained in the previous chapter. This
semi-classical approximation provides a deeper physical insight than
the expansion in Bessel functions from the improved Keldysh
approximation~\cite{Kopold_1997sfa}, as it captures the essential
underlying physics. It also establishes a connection between
\textsc{ati} calculations within the framework of the strong-field
approximation and the concept of quantum
paths~\cite{KopoldOptComm2000}, which represent space-time
trajectories of the tunneling electrons. This concept has its origins
in the alternative formulation of quantum mechanics introduced by
Feynman in terms of path integrals~\cite{RevModPhysFeynman}, in which
the probability amplitude of a quantum mechanical process can be
represented as a coherent superposition of contributions from all
possible spatio-temporal paths that connect the initial and final
state of the system.

This chapter presents the arguments of Kopold
et. al.~\cite{KopoldOptComm2000,phd_Kopold} in an attempt to reproduce
their study of \textsc{ati} on atoms, including electron rescattering,
and test for numerical stability. In view of this, the arguments
introduced in their saddle-point analysis of \textsc{ati} are
presented in the following sections. The saddle-point approximation
establishes the connection between the quantum mechanical path
integral formalism and the improved Keldysh approximation discussed in
Sec.~\ref{kopold_sfa}. The transition amplitude that describes the
ionization of an electron under an external laser field is evaluated
within the two frameworks, that in which only direct electrons are
considered as well as the case that incorporates rescattering off the
parent ion. Our study follows those in Refs.~\cite{Kopold_1997sfa,
  KopoldOptComm2000}.

\section{\label{sec:q_paths} Quantum-orbit formalism}

Several quantum models have been introduced in the literature that
extend the scope of the Keldysh approximation for strong laser-atom
interactions. A generalization of the Keldysh-Faisal-Reiss
(\textsc{kfr}) formulation of \textsc{ati} explores the dynamics of
the ionized electrons under a high-intensity laser, including
rescattering effects, by means of a representation of the
time-evolution operator as an expansion with respect to the
interaction with the atomic binding
potential~\cite{Kopold_1997sfa}. The \textsc{kfr} theory of
\textsc{sfa} has also been extended to the study of
harmonic generation~\cite{LewensteinSPA_1994,Lewenstein_1995} by means
of a quantum model that takes into account additional interactions of
the ionizing electron with the ion core including higher-order terms
in a perturbative expansion leading to rescattering effects. This
model, which extends beyond zero-range potentials, constitutes a
quantum mechanical formulation of the three-step semiclassical
picture~\cite{Becker_2step1986}, which has proven to be crucial in
understanding strong-field laser-atom interactions. These models,
which incorporate rescattering effects of the excited electrons, have
been valuable in unraveling the physical phenomena behind the
\textsc{ati} plateau and its cutoff, an intrinsic feature of the
ionization spectrum.

A quasi-classical analysis of this generalization, based on the
saddle-point method and the path integral
formalism~\cite{KopoldOptComm2000,Becker_ellipticalSPA,LewScience2001},
has been particularly useful as it illustrates fundamental aspects of
the physics underlying strong-field ionization processes as well as
the formation of their spectra. This approach suggests that one
pictures the processes taking place in laser-atom interactions, such
as \textsc{ati} and high-harmonic generation (\textsc{hhg}), in terms
of electron trajectories in phase space. These quantum trajectories,
as it is explained below, follow classical Newtonian dynamics,
however, time must be defined in the complex plane to account for
tunneling ionization. Consequently, they present non-zero imaginary
components for the ionization time, rescattering time and momentum,
which determine the probability of the process. Their physical content
is reflected in the electron dynamics: once it has been ionized at
time $t'$, the electron may return to its parent ion at a later time
$t$ and rescatter after propagating in the continuum with momentum
$\mathbf{k}$ under the action of the external field.

As a starting point in the evaluation of the \textsc{ati} probability
amplitude~\ref{eq:mp_compact} by means of a saddle-point
approximation, we consider the compact form of the Volkov state in the
length gauge (see Appendix~\ref{app:L_gauge}), which can be expressed
as~\cite{Becker_ati2002}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:volkov_Lgauge}
\begin{split}
|\psi_{\mathbf{p}}^{(V)}(t)\rangle & = &
|\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{A}(t)\rangle e^{-i S_{\mathbf{p}}(t)},
\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $|\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{A}(t)\rangle$ represents a plane-wave
state with momentum $\mathbf{k} = \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{A}(t)$ and
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \begin{split}
    S_{\mathbf{p}}(t) & = & 1/2 \int\limits^{t} d\tau
    [\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{A}(\tau)]^{2}
  \end{split}
  \label{eq:action_system}
\end{eqnarray}
%
denotes the action of the system.

In view of the completeness of the plane-wave states as required by
the evolution operator formalism, it can be verified that the Volkov
time-evolution operator, which replaces the exact time-evolution
operator in the \textsc{sfa}~\cite{KeldyshSFA},
expressed in terms of a Volkov-state
decomposition~(\ref{eq:volkov_Lgauge}) by
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:te_volkov}
\begin{split}
U^{(V)}(t,t') & = & \int d^{3}\mathbf{k}
|\psi_{\mathbf{k}}^{(V)}(t) \rangle
\langle \psi_{\mathbf{k}}^{(V)}(t')|,
\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
%
is the solution to the initial-value problem~(\ref{eq:Uv_SchEq}), with
$U^{(V)}(t',t') = \hat{1}$, where $\hat{1}$ is the unit
operator~\cite{BeckerTEOp_2006,cjp2010_keldysh}.
%(seeJPhysB39)

Inserting the expansion~(\ref{eq:te_volkov}) into the matrix
element~(\ref{eq:mp_compact}) and taking into account the time
dependence of the ground state wave function, $|\psi_{0}(t) \rangle =
e^{i|E_{0}|t} | \psi_{0} \rangle$, one may write the probability
amplitude as the five-dimensional integral~\cite{KopoldOptComm2000}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:mp_5Dintegral}
  \begin{split}
    M_{\mathbf{p}} \sim & \int\limits_{-\infty}\limits^{\infty} dt
    \int\limits_{-\infty}\limits^{t} \int d^{3}\mathbf{k}\ 
    \langle [\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{A}(t)] e^{iS_{\mathbf{p}}(t)} | V |
    \mathbf{k} + \mathbf{A}(t) \rangle e^{-iS_{\mathbf{k}}(t)} \\
    & \times
    \langle [\mathbf{k} + \mathbf{A}(t')] e^{iS_{\mathbf{k}}(t')} | V |
    \psi_{0} \rangle e^{i|E_{0}|t'} \\
    \sim &
    \int\limits_{-\infty}\limits^{\infty} dt
    \int\limits_{-\infty}\limits^{t} \int d^{3}\mathbf{k}\ 
    \exp\ i\left[ S_{\mathbf{p}}(t) - S_{\mathbf{k}}(t)
      + S_{\mathbf{k}}(t') + |E_{0}|t' \right] \\
    & \times
    \langle \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{A}(t) | V |
    \mathbf{k} + \mathbf{A}(t) \rangle 
    \langle \mathbf{k} + \mathbf{A}(t') | V |
    \psi_{0} \rangle.
  \end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
%
The action for \textsc{ati}, in the exponent
of~(\ref{eq:mp_5Dintegral}) consists of three terms
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:action_mpintegral}
  \begin{split}
    S_{\mathbf{p}}(t, t', \mathbf{k}) & = & - \frac{1}{2}
    \int\limits_{t}\limits^{\infty} d\tau [\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{A}(\tau)]^{2}
    - \frac{1}{2} \int\limits_{t'}\limits^{t} d\tau [\mathbf{k} + \mathbf{A}(\tau)]^{2}
    + \int\limits_{-\infty}\limits^{t'} d\tau |E_{0}|,
  \end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
%
which correspond to the action of the entire system after rescattering
at time $t$, between ionization and rescattering where the
intermediate free-electron momenta is indicated by $\mathbf{k}$, and
before the electron is ionized at time $t'$, respectively. The
rescattering amplitude, $M_{\mathbf{p}}$, which is responsible for the
high-energy plateau in the electron energy spectrum, takes the
form~\cite{Becker_ati2002,BeckerTEOp_2006}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:mp_final}
\begin{split}
M_{\mathbf{p}} \sim &
\int\limits_{-\infty}\limits^{\infty} dt
\int\limits_{-\infty}\limits^{t} dt'
\int d^{3}\mathbf{k} \exp \left[ iS_{\mathbf{p}}(t, t', \mathbf{k}) \right]
m_{\mathbf{p}}(t, t', \mathbf{k}),
\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
%
with
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:mp_braketfunction}
  \begin{split}
    m_{\mathbf{p}}(t, t', \mathbf{k}) & = &
    \langle \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{A}(t) | V |
    \mathbf{k} + \mathbf{A}(t) \rangle 
    \langle \mathbf{k} + \mathbf{A}(t') | V |
    \psi_{0} \rangle.
  \end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
%
This amplitude corresponds to the so-called three-step
model~\cite{Becker_ati2002}, in which $V$ represents the potential
that the ionized electron experiences when it rescatters off its
parent ion. In order to evaluate the total probability amplitude, one
needs to integrate over the interval of ionization times $t'$ during
which the electric field is non-zero, integrate over all intermediate
electron momenta $\mathbf{k}$, and over all rescattering times $t >
t'$. The amplitude~(\ref{eq:mp_final}) can be approximated using a
saddle-point method~\cite{Lewenstein_1995}, in which the leading
contribution to the \textsc{ati} spectrum is determined by requiring
stationarity of the quasiclassical
action~(\ref{eq:action_mpintegral}).
% comment from JphysB39 about evaluating Mp using a saddle-point
% approximation


% point out the contrast with feynman's path integral
% p-57 chapter
It is revealing to point out the contrast of the ionization
amplitude~(\ref{eq:mp_final}), obtained with the strong-field
approximation, with its analogous representation in terms of Feynman
path integral formulation~\cite{RevModPhysFeynman}. The time evolution
operator of the entire system has the path integral representation
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:te_path}
\begin{split}
U(\mathbf{r}t, \mathbf{r}'t') & = &
\int\limits_{(\mathbf{r}',t')\to(\mathbf{r},t)}
\mathcal{D}\left[ \mathbf{r}(\tau) \right] e^{i S(t, t')},
\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
where $S(t, t') = \int\limits_{t'}\limits^{t} d\tau
\mathcal{L}[\mathbf{r}(\tau), \tau]$ is the action calculated along a
specific path by integrating the Lagrangian of the entire system along
that path, and the integral measure denoted by $\mathcal{D}\left[
  \mathbf{r}(\tau) \right]$ establishes a coherent sum over all
possible paths that connect $(\mathbf{r}t)$ and
$(\mathbf{r}'t')$. This sum is, in fact, an infinite-dimensional
functional of integrals, and can be reduced, within the framework of
the \textsc{sfa}, to a sum over a few quantum orbits. By
implementing the \textsc{sfa} we have approximated the
exact action of the system at the various stages of the process:
before ionization, in between ionization and rescattering, and after
rescattering, as Eq.~(\ref{eq:action_mpintegral}) indicates. The
ionization amplitude is then computed by means of a sum over the
exponential of the action over a five-parameter set of paths,
parametrized by the ionization time $t'$, the rescattering time $t$
and the canonical momentum of the orbit denoted by
$\mathbf{k}$~\cite{KopoldOptComm2000}.

% ref from Principles...Lewenstein&LHuillier
% it is needed here an explanation of what the saddle-point
% approximation is and why it is justified to use it
In the low-frequency limit and for high-intensity laser fields, the
five-dimensional set of paths over which the transition
amplitude~(\ref{eq:mp_final}) is evaluated can be reduced further by
invoking the saddle-point approximation~\cite{,Lewenstein_1995} to
calculate the integral over $\mathbf{p}$ as well as $t$ and $t'$. In
this regime, the transition amplitude contains a rapidly oscillating
factor, $\exp\ iS_{\mathbf{p}}(t, t', \mathbf{k})$, provided that the
parameters $U_{p}$, $I_{p}$, and $p^{2}$ in the quasi-classical
action~(\ref{eq:action_mpintegral}) are large enough. The major
contributions to the integrals in~(\ref{eq:mp_final}) come from the
saddle points that render the phase stationary.

% mention deformation of the integration path into the complex plane
% mention why the trajectories are complex
In the process of evaluating the transition amplitude, the phase of
the integrand is expanded about the saddle-points along the path of
steepest descent in the complex plane. As a result, a handful of
relevant paths remains to be considered in order to explore the
\textsc{ati} spectrum~\cite{KopoldOptComm2000}. Since the tunneling
process of an electron is involved in this analysis, these paths take
place in the complex time domain.
%
The condition
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:S_stationary}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial S}{\partial q_{i}} & = & 0
\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
where $q_{i}(i =1, \dots, 5)$ runs over the five variables $t$, $t'$
and $\mathbf{k}$, leads to the saddle-point
equations~\cite{Lewenstein_1995,KopoldOptComm2000}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:saddle_eqs}
\begin{split}
\left( \mathbf{k} + \mathbf{A}(t') \right)^{2} = &
-2|E_{0}| \\
\left( \mathbf{k} + \mathbf{A}(t)\right)^{2} = &
\left( \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{A}(t) \right)^{2} \\
(t - t') \mathbf{k} = & -\int\limits_{t'}\limits^{t}
d\tau \mathbf{A}(\tau).
\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
%
The solutions $(t_{S}(\mathrm{Re}\ t_{S} > \mathrm{Re}\ t'_{S}),
t'_{S}, \mathbf{k}_{S})$, are known as the stationary points of the
quasiclassical action of the system, and define the quantum orbits
which are the essential components in building the ionization spectrum
through the saddle-point approximation. From a physical perspective,
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:saddle_eqs}) ensure the energy conservation at the time
of tunneling, elastic scattering of the electron into its final state
when it returns, and that in fact the electron returns to its parent
ion, respectively. Since $|E_{0}| > 0$ in~(\ref{eq:saddle_eqs}), the
condition of energy conservation at the time of ionization cannot be
satisfied for any real time $t'$. As a consequence, the solutions
$(t_{S}, t'_{S}, \mathbf{k}_{S})$ of the saddle-point equations
describe complex orbits which puts limitations on a straightforward
visualization of the trajectories.

%p-56 chapter ATI
The probability amplitude~(\ref{eq:mp_final}) can now be expressed in
terms of the saddle-point solutions as~\cite{KopoldOptComm2000}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:Mp_final}
\begin{split}
M_{\mathbf{p}} \sim & \sum\limits_{i} \left( \frac{(2\pi i \hbar)^{5}}
{\mathrm{det} (\partial^{2}S / \partial q_{j} \partial q_{k})_{j,k = 1, \dots, 5}}
\right)^{1/2} \times \exp(i S(t_{S_{i}}, t'_{S_{i}}, \mathbf{k}_{S_{i}})),
\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $q_{i}(i = 1,\dots,5)$ runs over the five variables $t_{S},
t_{S}'$ and $\mathbf{k}_{S}$. The sum~(\ref{eq:Mp_final}) involves a
reduced set of trajectories that are sufficient to approximate the
ionization spectrum through their interferences, which have
constructive and destructive contributions.


\section{\label{sec:spa_results} Results}
% mention that we explore the quantum trajecotries that are relevant
% to the ATI spectrum

This section presents the results corresponding to a saddle-point
analysis of the probability amplitude to detect \textsc{ati} electrons
that emerge from a model-helium atom under a strong laser field of the
form~(\ref{eq:lp_field}). In order to obtain comparable results to the
quantum generalization of the \textsc{sfa} presented in
Chapter~\ref{cha:ati}, the laser intensity and frequency were set to
$I = 10^{15}\ \mathrm{W/cm^{2}}$ and $\omega = 0.0584\ \mathrm{a.u.}$,
respectively.

% introduce direct trajectories and rescattering

\subsection{\label{sec:spa_direct} Direct trajectories}

The probability amplitude for detecting an \textsc{ati} electron that
propagates with momentum $\mathbf{p}$ in the continuum as a result of
the laser irradiation of an atom, originally in its ground state, is
studied in this section. The action of a system consisting of a bound
electron that is ionized at time $t_{0}$, without further interaction
with the parent ion, has the form~\cite{phd_Kopold,Becker_ati2002}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:action_direct}
  \begin{split}
  S_{\mathbf{p}}(t_{0}) & = &
-\frac{1}{2}\int_{t_{0}}^{\infty}{d\tau [\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{A}(\tau)]^{2}}
- \int_{-\infty}^{t_{0}}{d\tau E_{0}},
\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
%
Since the main contribution to the transition
amplitude~(\ref{eq:Mp_final}) is given by the stationary points of the
action which satisfy the condition $dS_{\mathbf{p}} / dt_{0} = 0$, the
integral~(\ref{eq:Mp_final}) is evaluated by implementing a
saddle-point approximation~\cite{spa_1960}. This consists in expanding
the phase of the integrand, $\Phi(t) = (1/\eta) S(t) = (\omega /
U_{p}) S(t)$, in the vicinity of the points where the phase is
stationary, which results in determining the solutions of
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:stationary_points}
  \begin{split}
    \frac{\partial S_{\mathbf{p}}}{\partial t_{0}} & = &
    \frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{A}(t_{0}))^{2} + |E_{0}| = 0.
  \end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
%
The stationary points from Eq.~(\ref{eq:stationary_points}) have a
non-zero imaginary component, therefore, it is convenient to split the
integral of the action~(\ref{eq:action_direct}) in the complex time
domain by implementing the substitution $\omega t_{0} \to
\rm{Re}(\omega t_{0}) + i\rm{Im}(\omega t_{0})$. For a linearly
polarized laser field of the form~(\ref{eq:lp_field}), the location of
the saddle points can be determined analytically and their real and
imaginary components satisfy the conditions
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:ReIm_eqs}
  \begin{split}
    \cos^{2}(\rm{Re}\ \omega t_{0s}) = & \frac{1}{2}
    \left( 1 + \gamma^{2} + \frac{E_{p}}{2U_{p}} \right)
    - \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\left( \frac{E_{p}}{2U_{p}} \right)^{2}
    + (1 + \gamma^2)^2 + \frac{E_{p}}{U_{p}}(\gamma^2 - \cos 2\phi)}
    \\
    \cosh(\rm{Im}\ \omega t_{0s}) = & - \sqrt{\frac{E_{p}}{2U_{p}}}
    \frac{\cos\phi}{\cos(\rm{Re}\ \omega t_{0s})},
  \end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $\phi$ is the angle between the momentum $\mathbf{p}$ and the
direction of polarization of the laser field, $\hat{x}$. The electron
energy, as it propagates in the continuum, is indicated by $E_{p} =
p^{2}/2$. As Eqs.~(\ref{eq:ReIm_eqs}) indicate, an electron energy
$E_{p}$ is associated with four saddle-points $\omega t_{0s}$, $s = 1,
\dots, 4$, which are related to each other by complex conjugation.
These complex roots are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:sp_direct} for
electron energies within the range $(0, \dots, 6U_{p})$. The saddle
points with positive imaginary parts, $t_{01}$ and $t_{02}$, are shown
in blue, whereas the red connected dots, $t_{03}$ and $t_{04}$,
indicate points with negative imaginary parts. The contours defined by
the saddle points in phase space illustrate the integration paths to
follow for a given electron energy when constructing the \textsc{ati}
spectrum.

In a saddle-point evaluation of the integral~(\ref{eq:mp_final}), it
is convenient to refer to the asymptotic evaluation of the expression
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:I_eta_contour}
  I(\eta) = \int\limits_{\mathcal{C}} dz g(z) e^{\eta s(z)}
\end{eqnarray}
%
in the case where the functions $s(z)$ and $g(z)$ are analytic and
$\eta > 0$. The integration contour $\mathcal{C}$ is deformed into a
composition of contours $\mathcal{C}_{s}$ coinciding with the path of
steepest descent. This transformation into the complex plane, in which
the function $s(z) = s(x + iy) = u(x,y) + iv(x, y)$, leads to express
the saddle-point condition as
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:sp_uv_complex}
  (\nabla u) \cdot (\nabla v) = 0,
\end{eqnarray}
% mention that the contour is chosen by method of steepest descent
% where Im(v) = constant and what that represents in terms of the
% saddle points contributions to the integral. then taylor expansion
% in the vicinity of the saddle points leads to the Gaussian function
% for Mp
indicating that the curves along the directions of $\nabla u$ and
$\nabla v$ always meet orthogonally at any point. Ideally, one needs a
path near a point $z = z_{s}$ such that $u(x,y)$ attains a peak and
decreases away from $z = z_{s}$. However, the imaginary part $v(x,y)$
will in general also change and the exponential factor $e^{i\eta v}$
will oscillate rapidly in the vicinity of $z_{s}$. If the point $z =
z_{s}$ coincides with a saddle point, a suitable path is one where
$v(x,y)$ is nearly constant as one moves away from $z_{s}$, in other
words, when the exponential term in~(\ref{eq:I_eta_contour}) can be
expressed as~\cite{phd_Kopold}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:exp_steepest}
  e^{\eta u(x,y) + i \eta v(x,y)} = e^{\eta u(x,y)} e^{i \eta v(x_{s},y_{s})}.
\end{eqnarray}
%
Therefore, in order to calculate the saddle point contributions to the
integral, one chooses the integration path such that
$\mathrm{Im}\ s(z) = \mathrm{Im}\ s(z_{s})$. Along the direction of
steepest descent for the surface $u(x,y) = u(x_{s},y_{s})$, defined by
$-\nabla u|_{z_{s}} = - (\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial
  u}{\partial y})|_{z_{s}}$, the Cauchy-Riemann equations justify that
the tangents to the surface $v(x,y) = v(x_{s},y_{s})$ lie in the
direction of steepest descent through $z_{s}$. In a contour
$\mathcal{C}_{s}$ that goes through the saddle points of $s(z)$, the
main contribution to the integral in the transition probability comes
from the saddle point $z_{s} = x_{s} + iy_{s}$ or its immediate
vicinity. Therefore, a Taylor expansion of the
action~(\ref{eq:action_direct}) around the saddle point $z_{s}$ in the
form
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:taylor_exp}
  s(z) \simeq s(z_{s}) + \frac{1}{2!}s''(z_{s})(z - z_{s})^{2} 
\end{eqnarray}
%
is justified. This approximation allows for an analytic determination
of the saddle point contributions to the
integral~(\ref{eq:I_eta_contour}), which can be written as a Gaussian
integral and evaluates to~\cite{phd_Kopold}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:I_Gaussian}
  I(\eta) \simeq \sum\limits_{s\mathrm{\epsilon} \mathcal{Z}_{\mathcal{C}}}
  \pm g(z_{s}) e^{\eta s(z_{s})} \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{-\eta s''(z_{s})}},
\end{eqnarray}
%
provided that the original contour $\mathcal{C}$ is deformed into a
composition $\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{max}}$ of contours
$\mathcal{C}_{s,\mathrm{max}}$ which are regions where $s(z)$ and
$g(z)$ are analytic, with identical boundary points
$\partial\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{max}} = \partial\mathcal{C}$. The sum
in~(\ref{eq:I_Gaussian}) runs over a partial set of all saddle points
whose contours $\mathcal{C}_{s,\mathrm{max}}$ combine into
$\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{max}}$.

Accordingly, the \textsc{kfr} matrix element for direct electrons can
be approximated by a Gaussian function~\cite{phd_Kopold}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:KFR_Mp}
  \begin{split}
    M_{\mathbf{p}} & \sim & \int\limits_{0}\limits^{T} dt\ e^{i \eta \Phi(t)},
  \end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
%
in which the phase is defined as $\Phi(t) = S_{\mathbf{p}}(t)\omega /
U_{p}$, and the period of the laser field is indicated by $T$. The
integration path to follow is defined by a contour of saddle points

  \begin{split}
    M_{\mathbf{p}} & \sim & \sum\limits_{i}
    \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{-i S''_{\mathbf{p}}(t_{s_{i}})}}
    \exp iS_{\mathbf{p}}(t_{s_{i}}),
  \end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $t_{s_{i}}$ denote the saddle points that lie in the contour of
interest. Equation~(\ref{eq:Mp_spa_direct}) approximates the
\textsc{ati} spectrum for an electron that, after being ionized at
some time $t_{0}$ under a strong laser field, propagates under the
influence of the field with no further interaction with the binding
potential.

In order to visualize the regions in phase space where the action
$S_{\mathbf{p}}$ is stationary and, consequently, construct an
integration path of stationary phase through the saddle-points, it is
convenient to carry out the substitution $t \to t_{r} + it_{i}$ in
Eq.~(\ref{eq:action_direct}). For a monochromatic laser
field~(\ref{eq:lp_field}), and assuming that the electron path is
parallel to the electric field of the laser, the real and imaginary
components of the phase take the form~\cite{phd_Kopold}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:phase_im}
  \begin{split}
    \mathrm{Im}\ i\Phi(t) & = & \omega t_{r} ( 1 + \frac{E_{p}}{U_{p}}
    + 2\gamma^{2} ) +
    \frac{1}{2} \sin 2\omega t_{r} \cosh 2\omega t_{i}
    + 2\sqrt{\frac{2E_{p}}{U_{p}}} \sin\omega t_{r} \cosh\omega t_{i}
  \end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:phase_re}
  \begin{split}
    -\mathrm{Re}\ i\Phi(t) & = & \omega t_{i} (
    1 + \frac{E_{p}}{U_{p}} + 2\gamma^{2} )
    + \frac{1}{2} \cos 2\omega t_{r} \sinh 2\omega t_{i}
    + 2\sqrt{\frac{2E_{p}}{U_{p}}} \cos\omega t_{r} \sinh\omega t_{i}.
  \end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
%
At a given electron energy, the permitted integration contours follow
from $\mathrm{Im}\ i \Phi(t) = \mathrm{Im}\ i \Phi(t_{si})$, and
Eq.~(\ref{eq:phase_im}) allows to write them explicitly as a function
of $t_{i}(t_{r})$. Figure~\ref{fig:sp_contours} shows contours for
constant imaginary part of the exponent in Eq.~(\ref{eq:KFR_Mp}), as
well as the set of saddle points corresponding to an electron energy
of $2.27 U_{p}$, indicated by crosses ($\times$). The blue curve
corresponds to contours with $\mathrm{Im}\ i \Phi(t) = \mathrm{Im}\ i
\Phi(t_{s_{1},s_{3}})$, while contours with $\mathrm{Im}\ i \Phi(t) =
\mathrm{Im}\ i \Phi(t_{s_{2},s_{4}})$ are indicated by a red
curve. The purple scale represents the real values of the exponent
$i\Phi(t)$, in which dark regions indicate small values of
$\mathrm{Re}\ i\Phi(t)$, while bright regions indicate large values of
$\mathrm{Re}\ i\Phi(t)$. This implies that, for every single electron
energy, $E_{p}$, only one possible integration path is relevant in
order to evaluate the transition amplitude $M_{\mathbf{p}}$: the one
starting at $t = 0$ to $+i\infty$, $C_{a}$, then along $C_{1}$ across
the saddle point $t_{01}$ up to $\omega t = \pi + i\infty$ where the
integrand vanishes, from there along $C_{2}$ across the second saddle
point, $t_{02}$, to $\omega t = 2\pi + i\infty$, and finally along
$C_{b}$ to $\omega t = 2\pi$. The integrands along $C_{a}$ and $C_{b}$
are identical and the integrals add up to zero due to the reversed
integration orders. Along contours $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$, the integrand
is approximated by the Gaussian~(\ref{eq:Mp_spa_direct}) with $i = 1,
2$. For a given electron energy, $E_{p}$, the probability
amplitude~(\ref{eq:Mp_spa_direct}) is evaluated along the integration
trajectory that contains the saddle-points with positive imaginary
parts, $t_{01}$ and $t_{02}$, indicated as blue connected dots in
Figure~\ref{fig:sp_direct}, in order to obtain a converging result
when evaluating the exponential term in $M_{\mathbf{p}}$.

quantum calculation in terms of an expansion in Bessel

out, the saddle-point approximation generates an \textsc{ati} spectrum
that vanishes at approximately $2.5 \mathrm{U_{p}}$ as the electron
escapes the effects of the binding potential without further
interaction with the parent ion.

\subsection{\label{sec:spa_resc} Trajectories with rescattering}

% fundamental features of rescattering, how is this approached
% see PhysRevA55 comments about rescattering and the plateau (introduction)
Incorporating rescattering effects, in which ionized electrons are
allowed to return to the parent ion, is important in the study of
\textsc{ati} as it expands the possible physical interpretations to
the ionization spectrum. In particular, it elucidates the origin of
the extended \textsc{ati} plateau which can be observed at high
electron energies~\cite{Walker_1996}. This plateau, a key feature to
the laser induced \textsc{ati}, is thoroughly justified when
rescattering effects are included in the
analysis~\cite{Paulus_1994plateau,BeckerRescattering_2018}, and has
been widely addressed in the literature under the hypothesis that the
electrons that are responsible for this plateau gain their energy
through backscattering when upon propagation in the laser field they
return to the vicinity of the parent
ion~\cite{Paulus_1994plateau,Becker_1994plateau_classical,Becker_rescattering1994}. It
is the purpose of this section to revisit a saddle-point approximation
of the rescattering picture in which the quantum orbits of the ionized
electron play an essential part in the formation of the \textsc{ati}
spectrum~\cite{KopoldOptComm2000}.


%has been well
%described by a three-step model that employs a zero-range binding
%potential as well as rescattering
%effects~\cite{Becker_rescattering1994,Kopold_1997sfa}. 


% equations to determine the physical magnitudes (t, t', k) that
% define the complex trajectories, i.e., saddle points
In the recollision picture, an electron transitions from the ground
state into the continuum at time $t'_{S}$, ionization time, from that
time on the effects of the laser field in the electron dynamics are
dominant and the Coulomb potential of the parent ion becomes
negligible as the electron propagates in the continuum with momentum
$\mathbf{k}_{S}$, however, the model accounts for further interaction
with the binding potential as the electron is considered to return to
within the vicinity of the ion at time $t_{S}$, rescattering time, at
which the electron acquires its final asymptotic momentum
$\mathbf{p}$.

The relevant quantum orbits, defined by the complex saddle points
$(t'_{S}, t_{S}, \mathbf{k}_{S})$, are the solutions of the
saddle-point equations~(\ref{eq:saddle_eqs}) which have their origin
in the condition that the action of the system remains stationary
along those points. For the linearly-polarized
field~(\ref{eq:lp_field}), after some algebraic work on the
saddle-point equations, one can solve for the rescattering time and
ionization time as the numerical solutions of~\cite{KopoldOptComm2000}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:return_t}
  \begin{split}
    [\omega t_{S} \mp \arccos(2\cos\omega t_{S} + \delta \mp i\gamma)]
    (2\cos\omega t_{S} + \delta) \\
    \pm \sqrt{1 - (2\cos\omega t_{S} + \delta \mp i\gamma)^{2}} 
    - \sin\omega t_{S} = 0
  \end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
%
and
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:release_t}
  \begin{split}
    \omega t'_{S} = \mp \arccos(2\cos\omega t_{S} + \delta \mp i\gamma),
  \end{split}
\end{eqnarray}  
%
respectively, where the quantity $\delta$ is defined as $\delta =
\sqrt{p^{2} / (4U_{p})}$. Therefore, the complex paths are generated
for every possible set of saddle points $(t'_{i}, t_{i},
\mathbf{k}_{i})$, where $i$ indicates the $i-$th quantum
trajectory. As Eq.~(\ref{eq:return_t}) indicates, solutions for the
rescattering time come in complex conjugate pairs. Each optical cycle
$\omega T = 2\pi$ contains two solutions for the return time $t_{i}$
for each of the two possible combinations of signs.
%Additionally, the multi-valuedness of the $\arccos$ function leads to
%infinitely many solutions for $t_{i}$.
Considering the periodicity of the laser field~(\ref{eq:lp_field}), we
can focus our attention to the interval $0 < \mathrm{Re}\ t_{i} < T$
for the rescattering times. Subsequently, Eq.~(\ref{eq:release_t})
generates a pair of solutions for the ionization time $t'_{i}$ within
every interval delimited by $-(\frac{n+1}{2}) T < \mathrm{Re}\ t'_{i}
< -(\frac{n}{2})T$, with $n = 0,1,\dots$, as can be noticed in
Figure~\ref{fig:orbit_pairs} (right).

In Figure~\ref{fig:orbit_pairs}, a subset of these numerical solutions
illustrates the described distribution for the release and return
times corresponding to the first six quantum orbits, $i = 1, \dots,
6$, for a fixed electron energy of $E_{p} = 6 U_{p}$.  The release
times (right panel) illustrate how additional pairs of solutions
become available for lower energies, with $t'_{i}$ extending further
into the past. The electric field of the laser,
Eq.~(\ref{eq:lp_field}), is depicted in the left panel with
dash-dotted lines for the optical cycle $0 < \omega t < \omega T$
along with the solutions for the return times.

The value of the ponderomotive energy, $U_{p}$, at which the two
trajectories of a given pair approach each other most closely
corresponds to the cutoff of this pair. Typically, the orbits that
correspond to a given cutoff energy are defined as long and short
orbits~\cite{BeckerRescattering_2018}. Each pair of trajectories
$(i,j)$ has its well-defined cutoff at some energy,
$E_{\mathrm{cutoff}}$, at which the orbits come together, and the pair
ceases to contribute to the ionization spectrum for $E_{p} >
E_{\mathrm{cutoff}}$. The inset in the left panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:orbit_pairs} depicts the described behaviour for the
pair $(1,2)$ of quantum orbits, the curves indicate the numerical
solutions for the return times corresponding to three different values
of the electron energy. No solutions can be found for the return
times, and subsequently the release times, if the electron energy
exceeds the cutoff energy associated to a given pair. The cutoff
energy for the pair $(1,2)$ comes out to be $10.24 U_{p}$ as
Figure~\ref{fig:orbit_pairs} indicates. Typically, the travel time,
$\mathrm{Re}(t_{i} - t'_{i})$, associated with a quantum orbit
indicates the relevance of its contribution to the \textsc{ati}
spectrum, the ones with shorter travel time being qualitatively more
relevant, as they make up for the strongest contributions to the
ionization spectrum.



The complex orbits for the ionization time, rescattering time and
complex momentum, given by the saddle-point solutions of
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:return_t}) and~(\ref{eq:release_t}), are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:complex_paths} for trajectories $i = (1,\dots,6)$ as a
function of the electron kinetic energy $E_{p}$. A subset of the
energy values is indicated in multiples of $U_{p}$ along the paths. In
the process of obtaining the saddle points corresponding to
trajectories with increasing travel times, the substitution $\omega t
\to \omega t + 2\pi k$, with $k = 0,1,\dots$, was implemented in
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:return_t}) and~(\ref{eq:release_t}). The behaviour of
these complex trajectories is markedly different depending on the
location of the classical cutoff. Every pair of trajectories shows
that the quantum orbits approach each other closely near the
cutoff. For energies above the cutoff, the orbits in every pair
diverge away from one another and the ones with negative imaginary
parts stop contributing to the \textsc{ati} spectrum and are dropped
from the sum~(\ref{eq:Mp_final}), as they lead to a diverging solution
for the probability amplitude. This cutoff marks a turning point in
the complex paths. It can be noticed that both the rescattering times
and quantum momenta have very small imaginary parts before the cutoff,
while their imaginary components become noticeable as the electron
energies increase beyond the cutoff. In contrast, the imaginary parts
of the ionization times are significant, indicating the origin of the
electrons through tunneling ionization. For energies above the cutoff,
the real components of the complex paths remain approximately constant
with increasing energy. As a result, a marked drop appears after the
cutoff in the spectrum associated with a given pair of trajectories.

% add algebra on the action for trajectories with rescattering and

% paths being complex to account for tunneling ionization), which is
% later shown in Fig. 5.5
It is illustrating to take into account the complex nature of the
electron dynamics in order to visualize how the action of the system,
$S(t_{i},t'_{i},\mathbf{k}_{i})$, evolves as the electron energy
increases. To this end, one can write the explicit analytic expression
for the action in the event that the canonical momentum $\mathbf{k}$
and the final momentum $\mathbf{p}$ are parallel to the linearly
polarized laser field~(\ref{eq:lp_field}), which reads
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:action_analytic}
S(t, t', \bf{k}) & = &
-\frac{1}{2} \int_{t}^{\infty} d\tau\left[ p^{2}
+ 2 A_{0} p \cos(\omega\tau) + A_{0}^{2} \cos(\omega\tau)^{2} \right]\nonumber\\
&& -\frac{1}{2} \int_{t'}^{t} d\tau\left[ k^{2}
+ 2 A_{0} k \cos(\omega\tau) + A_{0}^{2} \cos(\omega\tau)^{2} \right]\nonumber\\
&& + \int_{-\infty}^{t'} d\tau|E_{0}|.
\end{eqnarray}
%
In the vicinity of the saddle points $(t_{i},t'_{i},\mathbf{k}_{i})$,
where the action satisfies the stationarity
condition~(\ref{eq:S_stationary}), the integration limits that cause
the integrand to diverge to $\pm\infty$ can be neglected. Some
algebraic simplifications on the analytic expression for the action
allow us to express the phase, $\Phi = (1/\eta)S$, in the probability
amplitude~(\ref{eq:Mp_final}) as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:phase_final}
\Phi(t, t', \bf{k}) & = &
\left(\frac{E_{P}}{U_{P}} - \frac{k^{2}}{2U_{P}}\right) \omega t
- \frac{2}{\sqrt{U_{P}}} \left( k - \sqrt{2E_{P}}\right) \sin(\omega t) \nonumber\\
&&
+ \left( \frac{k^{2}}{2U_{P}} + 1 + 2 \gamma^{2} \right)\omega t'
+ \frac{2}{\sqrt{U_{P}}} k \sin(\omega t') \nonumber\\
&&
+ \frac{1}{2} \sin(2\omega t'),
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $E_{P} = p^{2}/2$ indicates the electron energy.

%The phase is defined as Φ = (1/η)S = (ω/UP )S, where UP is the
%ponderomotive energy of the electron. Multiplying the action (12) by
%the 1/η factor and making use of the definitions of the ponderomotive
%energy and the Keldysh parameter one arrives at the expression

The phase values $S(t_{i},t'_{i},\mathbf{k}_{i})/\eta$, with $\eta =
35.8$, corresponding to the electron trajectories with the shortest
travel times $(i = 1, 2)$, are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:phase_ReIm} as
a function of the electron energy $E_{p}$ as blue/red lines,
respectively. A subset of energy values is specified along the curves
up to the cutoff energy, whereupon a crossing takes place between the
paths. Additionally, the complex coordinates of the action that were
graphically extracted from~\cite{phd_Kopold} are marked by crosses
($\times$) for the electron energies specified. The relative error of
the action~(\ref{eq:action_analytic}) with respect to the saddle-point
results from~\cite{phd_Kopold} is indicated with errorbars for the
three energies considered. For energies below the cutoff the most
noticeable changes occur in the real components, while the imaginary
parts of the individual trajectories change little as they approach
each other along the plateau. In contrast to the saddle point
behaviour (Figure~\ref{fig:complex_paths}), where in a given pair of
trajectories $(i, j)$ they diverge rapidly from one another towards
the cutoff, the complex contributions of the action approach one
another as the electron energy increases and eventually are
interchanged at the cutoff, at which point one of the trajectories
ceases to contribute to the \textsc{ati} spectrum.

% contributions become more and more similar. Because of this, the

The computation of the \textsc{ati} spectrum can now be carried out
once the solutions of the saddle-point equations are determined. To
this end, the appropriate subset of electron trajectories is inserted
into the matrix
element~(\ref{eq:Mp_final}). Figure~\ref{fig:ati_spectrum} depicts the
formation of the \textsc{ati} spectrum as an increasing number of
quantum orbits are included in the sum~(\ref{eq:Mp_final}). The
contribution to the spectrum of a given pair of trajectories $(i,j)$
reflects its cutoff energy, upon which the sequence of interference
maxima and minima is terminated by a sharp peak where the two
trajectories diverge and one of them increases exponentially and stops
contributing to the spectrum. The pair $(1,2)$ with the highest cutoff
energy (around $10 U_{p}$ as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:complex_paths})
and shortest travel time presents the dominant contribution to the
\textsc{ati} spectrum. The second most important contribution comes
from the pair $(3,4)$, which has the lowest cutoff energy at around $7
U_{p}$ and second shortest travel time. Its final broad-top maximum,
at around $6 U_{p}$, remains visible in the converged spectrum. As
further pairs of trajectories with increasing travel times are
included in the calculation, their overall contribution to the
spectrum decreases. In contrast with previous
results~\cite{KopoldOptComm2000}, in which the shortest six
trajectories provided a good approximation to the \textsc{ati}
spectrum, our calculations indicate to be more sensitive to adding
further trajectories to the sum~(\ref{eq:Mp_final}), as the converged
\textsc{ati} spectrum becomes visible with the contributions from $14$
quantum paths.




%Quantita-tively, however, its contribution is the second-most
%important and, consequently, its cutoff is visible in the complete
%spectrum to be discussed below. Each pair Ž2ny1,2n. produces a very
%regular pattern, a sequence of interference maxima and minima whose
%separation slightly decreases towards low electron energies 2.
