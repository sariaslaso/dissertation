\chapter{H$_{2}$O in an external electric dc field}
\label{cha:dc_h2o}

The dc Stark problem for the H$_{2}$O valence orbitals is addressed in
this chapter through the implementation of a complex scaling approach
that allows to study the effect of an external dc field on each
molecular orbital independently. The construction of an effective
potential that reflects the indivual properties of the orbitals is
crucial in this analysis.
