% outline of the chapter

The stark resonance parameters, which characterize the shift of the
molecular energy levels under an external dc field, are fundamental in
the study of the strong dc field ionization of molecular orbitals. In
the case of the water molecule, the multicentre nature and,
consequently, the additional degrees of freedom, make the strong dc
field ionization of H$_{2}$O an attractive and challenging problem
from the point of view of a theoretical description as well as
experimentally. Complex variable techniques, such as an exterior
complex scaling~\cite{Simon_1979,Scrinzi_2010} and complex-absorbing
potentiasl~\cite{RissMeyer_1993,Krause_2014}, have been implemented in
order to address the problem of molecular static-field ionization and
compute the induced Stark resonances.

The dc Stark problem for the H$_{2}$O valence orbitals is addressed in
this chapter by the implementation of a modified exterior complex
scaling approach that allows to study the ionization of the molecular
orbitals of H$_{2}$O under a strong dc field. The construction of an
effective potential, which reflects the indivual properties of the
orbitals, is crucial in this analysis. In Sec.~\ref{ch:h2o_structure},
we formulate the problem with emphasis on the representation of the
molecular orbitals. The exterior complex scaling formalism and its
implementation are introduced in Sec.~\ref{ch:h2o_ecs} as a crucial
step in finding a numerical solution to the problem. The Stark
resonance parameters are then presented in Sec.~\ref{ch:stark_params},
in which the symmetry properties of the orbitals are considered
independently. The analysis presented in this chapter compiles that
of~\cite{sarias_2016,sarias_2017}.

%symmetry properties of each molecular orbital in order to study the
%Stark resonances for the water molecule under an external static
%electric field
