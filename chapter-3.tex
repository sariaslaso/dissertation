% outline of the chapter

The stark resonance parameters, which characterize the shift of the
molecular energy levels under an external dc field, are fundamental in
the study of the strong dc field ionization of molecular orbitals
(\textsc{mo}s). In the case of the water molecule, the multicentre
nature of the combined Coulomb interactions and, consequently, the
additional degrees of freedom, make the strong dc field ionization of
H$_{2}$O an attractive and challenging problem from the point of view
of a theoretical description as well as experimentally. Complex
variable techniques, such as an exterior complex
scaling~\cite{Simon_1979,Scrinzi_2010} and complex-absorbing
potentiasl~\cite{RissMeyer_1993,Krause_2014}, have been implemented in
order to address the problem of molecular static-field ionization and
compute the induced Stark resonances.

The dc Stark problem for the H$_{2}$O valence orbitals is addressed in
this chapter by the implementation of a modified exterior complex
scaling approach that allows to study the ionization of the molecular
orbitals of H$_{2}$O under a strong dc field. The construction of an
effective potential, which reflects the indivual properties of the
orbitals, is crucial in this analysis. In Sec.~\ref{ch:h2o_structure},
we formulate the problem with emphasis on the representation of the
molecular orbitals. The exterior complex scaling formalism is
introduced in Secs.~\ref{ch:1b1_1b2} and~\ref{ch:3a1} as a crucial
step in finding a numerical solution to a spherically symmetric
problem, in the case of the $1b_{1}$ and $1b_{2}$ orbitals, and the
problem of a non-central effective potential, in the case of the
$3a_{1}$ orbital. The Stark resonance parameters are then presented in
Sec.~\ref{ch:stark_params}, in which the symmetry properties of the
orbitals are considered independently. The analysis presented in this
chapter compiles that of~\cite{sarias_2016,sarias_2017}.


\section{Molecular orbital representation of H$_{2}$O}
\label{ch:h2o_structure}
% Formulation of the Problem

The starting point for this study is the Hartree-Fock (\textsc{hf})
calculation of the H$_{2}$O molecular states using a single-center
Slater orbital
basis~\cite{Moccia_1964,Moccia_JCP_2164,Moccia_JCP_2176}, applied to
collision studies~\cite{Montanari_2013} and compared to experimental
electron spectroscopy~\cite{Hafied_2007}. Other elaborate descriptions
of the molecular structure of H$_{2}$O, formulated within the
independent-electron approximation by the self-consistent field
(\textsc{scf}) or variational Hartree-Fock method with multicentre
Slater orbitals in which the pioneering work of Ellison and
Shull~\cite{EllisonShullh2o_1955} is revised, are reference for
describing the electronic structure of diatomic molecules by means of
an expansion of Slater
orbitals~\cite{Pitzer_1968,Pitzer_1970}. However, the direct
application of these multicentre orbitals for strong-field studies
implies significant computational and methodological challenges.

The present work is intended to study the valence molecular orbitals
of H$_{2}$O, $1b_{1}$, $1b_{2}$ and $3a_{1}$. The wavefunctions for
the $1b_{1}$ and $1b_{2}$ molecular orbitals, which correspond to the
$2p_{x}$ and $2p_{y}$ oxygen orbitals, are dominated by a single
angular mometum symmetry. The $3a_{1}$ \textsc{mo}, on the other hand,
consists mainly of the oxygen $2s$ and $2p_{z}$ and the hydrogen $1s$
atomic orbitals.

The general expression for the basis functions, introduced as a set of
single-center
wavefunctions~\cite{Moccia_1964,Moccia_JCP_2164,Moccia_JCP_2176}, is
defined as a Slater-type orbital (\textsc{sto}),
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \begin{split}
 f_{nlm}(\zeta,r,\theta,\phi) & = & \sqrt{\frac{(2\zeta)^{2n+1}}{(2n)!}}
 r^{n-1} \exp(-\zeta r) S_{l, m}(\theta,\phi),
 \end{split}
\label{eq:sto}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where the angular part $S_{l,m}(\theta,\phi)$ represents real
spherical harmonics. The expansion coefficients and nonlinear
coeficients $\{\zeta_{i}\}$, determined by the Roothaan's
self-consistent-field method~\cite{Moccia_1964,Roothaan_1951}, are
used to construct a reduced form of the radial functions that describe
all the molecular orbitals. More specifically, we are interested in
using a reduced \textsc{sto} expansion to construct an effective
pontential that describes the response of the H$_{2}$O valence
orbitals when applying an electric dc field along the symmetry axis
(i.e., the $z-$axis).

Based on their symmetry properties, independent descriptions of the
valence molecular orbitals of H$_{2}$O are constructed. The dominant
components of the $1b_{1}$ and $1b_{2}$ orbitals, namely the $np_{x}$
and $np_{y}$ parts, are used to derive spherically symmetric effective
orbital-dependent potentials~\cite{sarias_2016}. While a similar
procedure is implemented for the $3a_{1}$ orbital, i.e., retaining the
$np_{z}$ parts of the \textsc{mo}, the strong asymmetry introduced by
the two protons located in the $y-z$ plane leading to significant
admixtures of $s-$type Slater orbitals in the Moccia
\textsc{sto}s~\cite{Moccia_1964} would have been ignored with a
spherically symmetric potential. Hence, for the dc ionization problem
of the $3a_{1}$ \textsc{mo}, \textsc{sto}s of type $2s$ and $2p_{z}$
are incorporated in the analysis.

\section{$1b_{1}$ and $1b_{2}$ molecular orbitals}
\label{ch:1b1_1b2}

The Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the bound-state problem of a
molecular orbital within an effective potential $V_{\mathrm{eff}}(r)$
is expressed in shperical polar coordinates as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  [ -\frac{1}{2} \frac{d^2}{dr^2} + \frac{\hat{L}^2}{2r^2} + V_{\rm{eff}}(r)] \psi
  & = & E\psi,
\label{eq:sch_noCS}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $\hat{L}^{2}$ is the orbital quantum momentum operator. The
present study involves the construction of the effective
orbital-dependent potential $V_{\mathrm{eff}}(r)$ extracted from the
single-centre Moccia wave functions~\cite{Moccia_1964}. Then an
exterior complex scaling (\textsc{ecs})~\cite{Simon_1979} is applied
to determine the numerical solution of the problem associated with a
molecular orbital in the presence of a strong electric dc field
applied along the $z$ direction~\cite{sarias_2016}. A schematic
representation of the geometry of the system is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:h2o_1b1_1b2}, where the orientation of the $1b_{1}$
and $1b_{2}$ \textsc{mo}s is indicated with respect to the plane where
the protons are located. The direction of the applied electric field
along $\hat{z}$ is included as well.

\begin{figure}

  \caption{Schematic display of the $1b_{1}\approx 2p_{x}$ (shown in
    yellow along the $x$ axis) and $1b_{2}\approx 2p_{y}$ (shown in
    blue along the $y$ axis) molecular orbitals. Also indicated (in
    green on the $y-z$ plane) is the orientation of the protons. The
    $z$ axis (in red) is the direction of the external electric field
    of strength $F_{0}$.}
  \label{fig:h2o_1b1_1b2}
\end{figure}


As a first step in solving Eq.~(\ref{eq:sch_noCS}) for the H$_{2}$O
molecular orbitals, we introduce the reduced single-centre Moccia
wavefunction,
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \begin{split}
    \psi_{1b_{1},1b_{2}}(r) & = & \sum\limits_{i} c_{nlm} f_{nlm}(\zeta_{i}, r),
    \label{eq:sto_1b1_1b2}
  \end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
%
which approximates the molecular orbital by an eigenstate of a
spherically symmetric potential. The functions $f_{nlm}(\zeta_{i},r)$
represent the radial part of the Slater orbitals~(\ref{eq:sto}) with
$|m|=1$ for the magnetic quantum number, in which the \textsc{sto}
expansion is limited to $2p_{x}$ and $2p_{y}$ orbitals,
respectively. The set of expansion coefficients and non-linear
coefficients in~(\ref{eq:sto_1b1_1b2}), given in
Table~\ref{tab:1b11b2_coef}, represents a reduced selection of the
expansion parameters given by Moccia for the ground state of the water
molecule~\cite{Moccia_1964}.

In order to determine the effective potential corresponding to each
molecular orbital, the wavefunction~(\ref{eq:sto_1b1_1b2}) is inserted
into the single-electron Schr\"{o}dinger equation~(\ref{eq:sch_noCS}),
which is then solved for $V_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(1)}(r)$. Afterwards, the
so-called Latter correction~\cite{LatterCor_1955,sarias_2016} is
applied to ensure that the effective potential converges
asymptotically to $-1/r$, as expected in a Coulomb potential:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
V_{\mathrm{eff}}(r) = \left\{
\begin{split}
V_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(1)}(r)\  & \mathrm{for} & r < r_{0} \\
-1/r\  & \mathrm{for} & r > r_{0}
\end{split}
\right.
,
\label{eq:coulomb_tail}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where the point $r_{0}$ is determined from $V_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(1)}(r_{0}) =
-1/r_{0}$, and is found to be sufficiently large that the original
self-consistent field orbital energy used to derive
$V_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(1)}(r)$ is close to the eigenenergy
of~(\ref{eq:sch_noCS}), with at least two significant digits of
agreement, with $V_{\mathrm{eff}}(r)$ given
by~(\ref{eq:coulomb_tail}).

    potential as derived from~(\ref{eq:sch_noCS}) using the
    \textsc{scf} orbitals and eigenenergies, while the dashed lines

    dot-dashed lines indicate the eigenenergies obtained from the
    Moccia wavefunctions~\cite{Moccia_1964}.}

Figure~\ref{fig:Veff1b11b2} shows a comparison of the effective
potential $V_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(1)}(r)$ (solid lines), with black
representing the $1b_{1}$ \textsc{mo} and blue representing the
$1b_{2}$ \textsc{mo}, derived from the Moccia wavefunctions
representing the $1b_{1}$ and $1b_{2}$
\textsc{mo}s~\cite{Moccia_1964}, and the transformed electronic
potential $V_{\mathrm{eff}}(r)$ (dashed lines) after the Latter
correction was implemented. The effective potentials for the $1b_{1}$
and $1b_{2}$ \textsc{mo}s are given as the shallower and deeper
curves. As Figure~\ref{fig:Veff1b11b2} illustrates, one drawback of
the method is that the effective potential is orbital dependent. A
direct consequence is that the value of $r=r_{0}$, which sets the
position in $r$ where the Coulombic tail is imposed, differs between
the \textsc{mo}s, being almost two times larger for the $1b_{2}$
compared to the $1b_{1}$ \textsc{mo}.


\subsection{PDE approach and exterior complex scaling}
\label{ch:ecs_1b11b2}

This section discusses further the formalism implemented to calculate
the relevant resonance parameters in the problem of the H$_{2}$O
molecule exposed to a strong dc field. Having obtained an effective
potential to define the field-free Schr\"{o}dinger
equation~(\ref{eq:sch_noCS}) for an orbital obtained in the
\textsc{scf} method~\cite{Moccia_1964}, we proceed with the problem of
the molecule ionized by a strong dc field.

When an electric field is applied in the $\hat{z}$ direction,
$\mathbf{F} = F_{0}\hat{z}$, the separation of variables ansatz as
applied to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation~(\ref{eq:sch_noCS})
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \begin{split}
    \psi(r,\theta,\phi) & = & \psi(r,\theta)\exp(im\phi)
  \end{split}
\label{eq:sov}
\end{eqnarray}
%
leads to a partial differential equation (\textsc{pde}) in spherical
coordinates that represents the Stark problem for an H$_{2}$O orbital:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
 \begin{split}
  -\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^{2}\psi}{\partial r^2} - \frac{1}{2r^2}
  (\frac{\cos\theta}{\sin\theta} \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial\theta} + 
  \frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial\theta^2})
  + (\frac{m^2}{2r^2 \sin^2\theta} + V_{\mathrm{eff}}(r) - E +
  F_{0}r\cos\theta)\psi & = & 0.
  \end{split}
\label{eq:pde}
\end{eqnarray}
%
Here the complex eigenenergy $E$ contains the information about the
resonance position (real part), i.e., $E_{R}$ and width $\Gamma$
(imaginary part is $-\Gamma/2$), and may be expressed as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
E & = & E_{R} + iE_{I} = E_{R} - i\frac{\Gamma}{2}.
\label{eq:complex_E}
\end{eqnarray}
%
The imaginary part $\Gamma$ is related to the lifetime of the decaying
state $\tau$ via $\Gamma\tau = 1$. For the $1b_{1}$ and $1b_{2}$
orbitals we have $m=\pm 1$, respectively. The presence of the
effective potential $V_{\mathrm{eff}}(r)$ makes this problem
challenging in the sense that it is not possible to obtain separable
solutions like for the hydrogen atom in which a pure Coulomb potential
leads to separability in parabolic coordinates, as was discussed
in~\cite{Telnov_1989}. It is then necessary to generate a more general
solution by solving the \textsc{pde} numerically, e.g., by applying a
finite-element method.

The ionization regime of the water molecule is described by means of a
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that reveals discrete resonance eigenvalues
containing information about the quasibound states that tunnel through
the barrier or escape over the potential barrier for strong
fields. Among the different techniques implemented in the study of
atomic resonances, a standard tool is the method of complex
scaling~\cite{complexScaling,complexScalingBaslev,complexScalingSimon}. This
approach consists in extending the analytic domain of the Hamiltonian
of a given system by means of a mapping operator that results in
complex eigenvalues which provide direct access to the resonant states
of the Stark problem. For most phenomenological potentials, such as
molecules with fixed internuclear distances, a modified method of
scaling is required as an extension to cases where the potential is
analytic only outside some bounded region. In these cases, the
approach of exterior complex scaling (\textsc{ecs})~\cite{Simon_1979}
is more appropriate, as the potential needs to have analyticity
properties only in the region affected by the scaling, where one can
look for solutions which decay exponentially in the assymptotic region
of the potential. Both methods have been widely used in scattering
problems~\cite{complexScalingBaslev, complexScalingSimon}, in studies
of the Stark problem for multi-electron
systems~\cite{ScrinziJChemPhys_ECS,ScrinziJPhysB_ECS}, as well as in
time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation problems for strong
fields~\cite{ecsRuiz, ecsTao, ecsScrinzi}.

For our aim of studying the field ionization properties of H$_{2}$O
orbitals, we implement a modified \textsc{ecs} technique in which the
radial coordinates are extended into the complex plane by a phase
factor, which is turned on gradually beyond some distance from the
origin. This method allows us to address the tunneling and
over-barrier ionization problem by avoiding the complication of
describing quasibound states with outgoing waves for $r \to
\infty$. In the present work, the complex scaling transformation is
given by
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \begin{split}
    r & \rightarrow & r\exp(i\chi(r)),
  \end{split}
\label{eq:ecs_r}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $\chi$ is defined as a function of the $r$ coordinate with the
purpose of making the scaling gradually effective from some vicinity
of $r = r_{\mathrm{s}}$ on,
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \begin{split}
    \chi(r) & = & \frac{\chi_{\mathrm{s}}}{1+\exp[-\frac{1}{\Delta r}
        (r - r_{\mathrm{s}})]}.
  \end{split}
\label{eq:ecs_theta}
\end{eqnarray} 
%
For given $r_{\mathrm{s}}$ one has to choose $\Delta r$ to be
sufficiently small, so that the function $\chi(r)$ starts from small
values at $r = 0$. For large $r$, it converges to the value
$\chi_{\mathrm{s}}$.

The set of possible values for the asymptotic scaling angle
$\chi_{\mathrm{s}}$ and the parameters $r_{\mathrm{s}}$ and $\Delta
r$, which control where and how quickly the scaling is turned on, is
explored in detail in order to establish how sensitive the
\textsc{pde} solutions are and to test the effectiveness of the
comples scaling technique to absorb the outgoing wave. Numerous tests
were carried out to ensure that the ``exact'' results of
Telnov~\cite{Telnov_1989} for atomic hydrogen orbitals including $2p$
are reproduced.

In order to investigate the effects of the dc field on the H$_{2}$O
orbital energies it is necessary to consider the extra terms that the
\textsc{ecs}~(\ref{eq:ecs_r}) introduces in the Schr\"{o}dinger
equation~(\ref{eq:pde}). Additionally, we need to turn the scaling on
only in the regime $r > r_{0}$, as Eq.~(\ref{eq:coulomb_tail})
indicates, such that we have a simple Coulomb potential in the scaling
region. In order to make use of standard finite-element methods, the
complex-valued wave function is separated into real and imaginary
parts, such that a system of coupled differential equations is
obtained as follows~\cite{sarias_2016}:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  -\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^{2}\psi_{R}}{\partial r^2}-\frac{1}{2r^2}
  (\frac{\cos\theta}{\sin\theta}\frac{\partial\psi_{R}}{\partial\theta}+
  \frac{\partial^{2}\psi_{R}}{\partial\theta^2}) \nonumber\\
  +(\frac{m^2}{2r^2\sin^2\theta}+V_{\rm{eff}}^{R}(r)c_{2}-V_{\rm{eff}}^{I}(r)s_{2}
  -E_{R}c_{2}+E_{I}s_{2}+
  F_{0}r\cos\theta c_{3})\psi_{R} \nonumber\\
  +(-V_{\rm{eff}}^{R}(r)s_{2}-V_{\rm{eff}}^{I}(r)c_{2}+E_{R}s_{2}+E_{I}c_{2}-F_{0}r\cos\theta
  s_{3})\psi_{I} & = & 0, \nonumber\\
  \vspace{1cm}
  -\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^{2}\psi_{I}}{\partial r^2}-\frac{1}{2r^2}
  (\frac{\cos\theta}{\sin\theta}\frac{\partial\psi_{I}}{\partial\theta}+
  \frac{\partial^{2}\psi_{I}}{\partial\theta^2}) \nonumber\\
  +(\frac{m^2}{2r^2\sin^2\theta}+V_{\rm{eff}}^{R}(r)c_{2}-V_{\rm{eff}}^{I}(r)s_{2}
  -E_{R}c_{2}+E_{I}s_{2}+
  F_{0}r\cos\theta c_{3})\psi_{I} \nonumber\\
  +(V_{\rm{eff}}^{R}(r)s_{2}+V_{\rm{eff}}^{I}(r)c_{2}-E_{R}s_{2}-E_{I}c_{2}+F_{0}r\cos\theta
  s_{3})\psi_{R} & = & 0.
\label{eq:pde_system}
\end{eqnarray}
%
The labels $R$ and $I$ stand for real and imaginary parts,
respectively; also, the notation $[c_{k},s_{k}]$ is introduced to
represent $[\cos[k\chi(r)], \sin[k\chi(r)]]$, respectively, with
$k=2,3$ and $\chi(r)$ defined in~(\ref{eq:ecs_theta}). Note that the
effective potential has real and imaginary parts on account of the
coordinate transformation~(\ref{eq:ecs_r}).
 
The \textsc{pde} system~(\ref{eq:pde_system}) is solved numerically on
a rectangular mesh defined by the $(r, \theta)$ coordinates, which
take values in the domains $[\epsilon, r_{\mathrm{max}}]$ and
$[\eta,\pi - \eta]$, respectively. The parameters $\epsilon$ and
$\eta$ that define the coordinate ranges were chosen to be of the
order of $10^{-3}\ \mathrm{a.u.}$, and the $r$ coordinate extends to
$r_{\mathrm{max}} = 20\ \mathrm{a.u.}$ In order to find a correct set
of $\psi_{R{I}}(r,\theta)$ solutions, it is essential to impose proper
boundary conditions that ensure the wave functions vanish at the
limits of the mesh. For the $|m| = 1$ states we impose the condition
$\psi_{R{I}}(\epsilon,\theta) = \epsilon \sin(\theta) = \epsilon
P_{1}^{1}(\theta)$, which is consistent with the assumption that at
small $r = \epsilon$ the lowest term in an expansion in associated
Legendre polynomials dominates and behaves like $A r^{2}
\sin(\theta)$.

A two-parameter root search for $\{E_{R}, E_{I}\}$ is implemented by
solving the \textsc{pde} as if it were an inhomogeneous problem. We
pick a location in the $(r,\theta)$ plane where the probability
amplitude is expected to be large and vary $\{E_{R}, E_{I}\}$, i.e.,
effectively the complex energy $E$ to maximize the amplitude.


\section{$3a_{1}$ molecular orbital}
\label{ch:3a1}

% sec 2 of JPhysB
In this section we extend the approach to study the dc Stark problem
for the $3a_{1}$ molecular orbital of H$_{2}$O. Given the orientation
of this orbital with respect to the plane in which the two protons are
located it is deemed necessary to go beyond the spherical effective
potential approximation, which was implemented in
Sec.~\ref{ch:1b1_1b2} for the $1b_{1}$ and $1b_{2}$ orbitals, in order
to take into account the strong assymetry introduced by the protons in
the $y-z$ plane and the significant admixtures of $s-$type Slater
orbitals in the \textsc{sto}s~\cite{Moccia_1964}.

The proposed method to address this problem is to define a reduced
single-centre Moccia wavefunction,
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\psi_{3a_{1}}(r,\theta) = \sum_{n,l} c_{nl0} \varphi_{nl0}(r,\theta).
\label{eq:3a1Moccia_expansion}
\end{eqnarray}
%
Here the $\varphi_{nl}(r,\theta)$ are Slater orbitals with $m=0$ for
the magnetic quantum number, and we limited the expansion to
\textsc{sto}s of $2s$ and $2p_{z}$ type.
